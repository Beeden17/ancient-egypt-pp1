# [ANCIENT EGYPT WEBSITE](https://github.com/Beeden17/ancient-egypt-pp1.git)

## Introduction
Welcome to my first project. This project is a history website based on Ancient Egypt, many consider the country to be one of the greatest sources of archaeology in the world. This website shows you why this could be true. You will find lots of information regarding various topics based around the history of Ancient Egypt, including Places/Cities, Pharaohs and Landmarks.

A live website can be found [here](https://github.com/Beeden17/ancient-egypt-pp1.git)

#  1.0 USER EXPERIENCE
Since being a child I have always been interested with Egyptian culture, especially the early dynastic periods, since a child I have read books, been to museums to view artefacts and watched any videos or documentaries regarding the subject in awe. However, I have not come across a dedicated website to showcase the inspiring beauty of this fabulous place and the impact it has had on modern times.

This project will give an insight to various topics hoping to inspire the user to find out more.
