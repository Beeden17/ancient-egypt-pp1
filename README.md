# [ANCIENT EGYPT WEBSITE](https://github.com/Beeden17/ancient-egypt-pp1.git)

## Introduction

Welcome to my first project. This project is a history website based on Ancient Egypt, many consider the country to be one of the greatest sources of archaeology in the world. This website shows you why this could be true. You will find lots of information regarding various topics based around the history of Ancient Egypt, including Places/Cities, Pharaohs and Landmarks.

A live website can be found [here](https://github.com/Beeden17/ancient-egypt-pp1.git)

# 1.0 USER EXPERIENCE

Since being a child I have always been interested with Egyptian culture, especially the early dynastic periods, I have read books, been to museums to view artefacts and watched videos or documentaries regarding the subject in awe. However, I have not come across a dedicated website to showcase the inspiring beauty of this fabulous place and the impact it has had on modern times.

This project will give an insight in to various topics hoping to inform the user and satisfying their curisity.

# 2. FEATURES

## All PAGES

The Navigation bar is placed at the top of the screen, for ease of use and consistency. For laptops and desktops it has a hover effect and changes colour, inline with the colour scheme used to improve the user experience for. The page that you have selected also underlines in black so the user knows exactly which page they are on. A dropdown style menu was used for mobile devices.

Icons were used as a visual representation of each topic.

Social media links - all links are placed at the bottom of each page in the footer. All links open in a new tab.

Logo/text - an ANCIENT EGYPT favicon is placed in the browser and/or tab menu. A logo is also in the heading. This gives the context that the website is about the subject.

## HOME/LANDING PAGE

Hero image - a large image with cover text that shows what the page is about.

Topics section - a section that gives a brief explanation and interesting information about different topics.

## EXPLORE PAGE

Gallery - a selection of diferent images relative to the topics described, in a varied layout depending on device used to view the website.

## JOIN PAGE

Form - a section for the user to interact with, entering personal information to submit. Taking them to a form dump page when correct information is inputted.

# 3. TECHNOLOGIES USED

### HTML5 - the project uses HyperText markup language

### CSS - the project uses Cascading Style Sheets

### MICROSOFT EDGE - the project uses microsoft edge to debug and test the source code

### GOOGLE FONTS - Google fonts were used to import the "Aboreto" font into the style.css file which is used on all pages

### FONT AWESOME - this was used to import the icons used throughout the project

### FAVICON.IO - this was used to import the favicon used in the browser and tab menu

### GITHUB - this was used to store the project's code after being pushed from Git

### CODEANYWHERE - this was the environment used to build the project

# 4. TESTING

### BROWSER DEVELOPER TOOLS

I used Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome developer tools, to see how each worked. For every element that I added to my HTML, I would add the basic CSS to my stylesheet. I would then use the inspect element to try different styles. Once I was happy with the layout I would copy the CSS from the DEVTOOL into my stylesheet or amend it in the environment. This allows me to keep track of the code I am using.

### Responsive Tools

I used Am I Responsive to make sure that all my pages are responsive to all devices.

### W3C Validator Tools

I used W3C Markup to check for any errors within my HTML pages.

I had an Info notice on the .html pages for trailing slashes in the head. The HTML checker notified me that the Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values. I returned to the environment to remove these. However no warnings or errors were found.

I used Jigsaw W3C CSS Validation to check for any error within my CSS stylesheet. None were found.

## MANUAL TESTING

I have tested my site on Safari, Edge and google chrome on multiple devices. I also used the codeanywhere IDE to check for any issues before staging and commiting any code.

## THESE DEVICES WERE

#### Iphone SE

#### Iphone 12 Pro

#### iPad Air

#### iPad Mini

#### Galaxy Fold

#### Laptop with 1024px and above

## BELOW IS MY TESTING PROCESS FOR ALL PAGES VIA MOBILE AND OTHER DEVICES

### All PAGES

Navigation Bar:

HOME - When selecting "HOME", the browser redirects me to the HOME page. The text in the navigation bar also underlines black. It worked as expected.

EXPLORE - When selecting "EXPLORE", the browser redirects me to the EXPLORE page. The text in the navigation bar also underlines in black. It worked as expected.

JOIN - When selecting "JOIN", the browser redirects me to the JOIN page. The text in the navigation bar also underlines black. It worked as expected.

### TEXT

I checked that all text is in the correct and consistent size and font. I also checked that there were no typos.

I checked that all pages and elements were responsive. Checking each page on mobile and website and adjusting screen size to find break points. It worked as expected.

### FOOTER

Facebook - When selecting the Facebook icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the Facebook website. It worked as expected.
Instagram - When selecting the Instagram icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the Instagram website. It worked as expected.
Twitter - When selecting the Twitter icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the Twitter website. It worked as expected.
YouTube - When selecting the YouTube icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the YouTube website. It worked as expected.

## HOME PAGE

Hero image and cover text:
checking that the hero image and cover text are responsive on mobile and other devices. This worked as expected.

Discover topics:
Checking the brief descriptions and icons section is responsive on mobile and other devices. This worked as expected.

## EXPLORE PAGE

Various images expected to load relating to the brief description on the HOME page. Testing all images respond to the screen getting larger. The columns show an increase if this happens. Adding an alt attribute if the image does not load. This worked as expected.

## JOIN PAGE

Expect a form to be shown and responsive on mobile and other devices. Request for user information, for the user to interact with. Testing that each field of the form is required and inputted correctly before submitting. Checking that the JOIN IN/submit button works and processes the form, redirecting to a dump page. It worked as expected.

# 5. DEVELOPMENT CYCLE

There were many elements I changed, re-positioned and added from my original design as they were more visually appealing.

All pages:
I experimented with many colour variations but always wanted the colours to be relevant to Egypt, using the yellow colours to represent the Desert and the blue to represent the River Nile. I found the colours I have used to contrast well while representing these important factors. The icons used were also an important addition as they are similar to the use of hieroglyphics, also used in Ancient Egypt. I found the ones i used to represent each section well.

HOME/Landing page:
The hero image was a pivotal part of the design as it had to be an image that was synonymous with Egypt, I had researched and used different images but found the final one to be the most suited, it also went well with the colour scheme used throughout the project.
The Topic section was a part that took quite a lot of research and development as there is a vast amount of information regarding the country. I wanted the information to be brief enough that it is not overwhelming but detailed enough to keep the user intrigued.

EXPLORE page:
The images I used were intended to represent the topics explaned in the HOME/Landing page. I wanted the images to make the user feel inspired and curious while not being repetitive or too contrasting. I experimented with different layouts on the larger devices until I was happy with the layout. I found that using the masonry layout and using different column counts, I was able to achieve this.

JOIN page:
The form had to be rearranged to suit different devices and I had to work out how to present the radio buttons in the correct way on smaller devices while keeping the correct format on larger devices. I achieved this using CSS.
